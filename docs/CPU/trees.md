Trees are O(ln(n)) and tend to be widely used. But how much time do we loose by using them?

## Hardware description

* AMD Ryzen 5900x 12-Core @3.7GHz (zen3, up to 4.951GHz)
* 2x 32GB-DDR4-ECC-unbuffered (PN: 9965745-020.A00G)

## Î¼Bench list

### Arrays (malloc())

``` cpp
typedef uint32_t E;
E *aTest = (E*)malloc(max * sizeof(E));
```

### Vectors (std::vector)

``` cpp
typedef uint32_t E;
std::vector<E> vecTest;
```

### Red-Black tree (std::map)

``` cpp
typedef uint32_t E;
std::map<E, E> mapTest;
```

### Red-Black tree (optimized)

* Switch from 64b pointers to 32b array indexes
* No support variable length keys and payload (eg: strings)
* Room for improvement:
    * use 31b indexes to save 1 bit for the color (and 1 byte per element)

### B-tree

!!! todo
    Should reduce the number of memory jumps

## Step By Step Analysis

## Timing comparison

![Tree comparison linear scale](trees/tree-full-access-user-time-linear-scale.svg)

Observations:

* The curves are looking *logarithmic*
* The access pattern matters
* The random accesses are noisy and slower by magnitude orders

## CPU cycle comparison

![Tree comparison linear scale](trees/tree-full-access-time-linear-scale.svg)

Observations:

* Same results (the system is was not loaded)
* It's easier to see that with Trees, the efficiency is lower than 1%

## CPU cycle in loglog scale

![Tree comparison loglog scale](trees/tree-full-access-time-loglog-scale.svg)

Observations:

* Cache effects are clearly shown
* Vector/Array random accesses are slower
    * it's due to the benchmark implementation
    * a better one (and a larger one) should also show cache effects

## Hardware counters

![rbTree HW counters](trees/tree-full-rbtree-random-cache-counters.svg)

Observations:

* L2 influence from ~2^10 to 2^15
* The bump from 2^24 to 2^27 might be due to the L3 (I failed to retrieve the L3 misses from this CPU)
